                <h1>An opportunity to learn about photography and life on the road from being out in the field with me.
                    Who this opportunity might be for
                    Those who want to travel in a way that is different to tourists.
                    Aspiring photographers who want to learn by being out in the field and seeing how travel photos are taken.
                    The main things I am looking for are, knowledge of the local language or languages, as well as excellent communication and people skills. Familiarity with traditional communities and their cultures is a big bonus.

                    Below is a list of the countries that I am planning on visiting soon.
